# DeepSeek V4 ROCmFP4 Port Status

## Target

Convert the original checkpoint:

- Hugging Face: <https://huggingface.co/0xSero/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B>
- Local source: `/mnt/ai-models/gguf-sources/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B`

The target runtime is this isolated special llama ROCmFP4 feature tree:

- `/home/caf/strix-fp4/llama.cpp-deepseek-v4-rocmfp4-modern-port`

Do not treat a downloadable GGUF or a standalone DeepSeek V4 runtime as the
final artifact. They are references only.

## Current Result

The conversion and runtime pipeline is proven with fixtures generated from the
original 46-shard checkpoint:

| Fixture | Intermediate GGUF | Mixed ROCmFP4 GGUF | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| One layer | `/home/caf/strix-fp4/runtime-fixtures/deepseek-v4/deepseek-v4-flash-1layer-mxfp4-f16.gguf` | `/home/caf/strix-fp4/runtime-fixtures/deepseek-v4/deepseek-v4-flash-1layer-rocmfp4-mxfp4.gguf` | Minimal loader and graph gate |
| Three layers | `/home/caf/strix-fp4/runtime-fixtures/deepseek-v4/deepseek-v4-flash-3layer-mxfp4-f16.gguf` | `/home/caf/strix-fp4/runtime-fixtures/deepseek-v4/deepseek-v4-flash-3layer-rocmfp4-mxfp4.gguf` | First compressed-attention layer, ratios `[0, 0, 4]` |

The three-layer mixed fixture is about `7.1G` and contains:

| Tensor type | Count | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `Q4_0_ROCMFP4` | 36 | Dense matrices on the special ROCmFP4 path |
| `MXFP4` | 9 | Source-native routed expert matrices |
| `I32` | 3 | Token-id-to-expert-id hash routing tables |
| `Q5_K` | 2 | Shared expert quality-sensitive matrices |
| `Q6_K` | 3 | Output matrices |
| `F32` | 35 | Small scales, norms, routing data, and compressor data |

The routed experts must remain `MXFP4`. Requantizing them expands work,
introduces avoidable quality risk, and defeats the checkpoint's native packed
representation. The hash-routing tables must remain `I32`.

## Reproduce Fixtures

Run the default one-layer fixture:

```bash
scripts/run-deepseek-v4-rocmfp4-fixture.sh
```

Run the compressed-attention fixture:

```bash
scripts/run-deepseek-v4-rocmfp4-fixture.sh \
  /mnt/ai-models/gguf-sources/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B \
  /home/caf/strix-fp4/runtime-fixtures/deepseek-v4 \
  3
```

Run the one-layer-plus-MTP fixture:

```bash
scripts/run-deepseek-v4-rocmfp4-fixture.sh \
  /mnt/ai-models/gguf-sources/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B \
  /home/caf/strix-fp4/runtime-fixtures/deepseek-v4 \
  1 \
  1
```

The script converts the requested layer count, performs a guarded quantizer
dry-run, writes the mixed ROCmFP4/MXFP4 fixture, and validates critical tensor
types. For three or more layers it also validates compressor and indexer
tensors from the first compressed-attention block.

## Runtime Gate

The three-layer compressed-attention fixture generates eight forced completion
tokens on CPU, ROCm, and Vulkan:

| Backend | Prompt processing | Decode | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| CPU | `81.70 tok/s` | `61.28 tok/s` | Operation offload disabled |
| `ROCm0` | `124.10 tok/s` | `78.65 tok/s` | Functional; FlashAttention auto-disables because DeepSeek helper operations still use CPU fallback |
| `Vulkan0` | `205.34 tok/s` | `101.28 tok/s` | Functional with current Vulkan backend coverage |

These are truncated-fixture smoke measurements, not full-model performance
claims.

Run the bounded smoke harness:

```bash
scripts/run-deepseek-v4-rocmfp4-smoke.sh \
  /home/caf/strix-fp4/runtime-fixtures/deepseek-v4/deepseek-v4-flash-3layer-rocmfp4-mxfp4.gguf \
  ROCm0
```

Replace `ROCm0` with `CPU` or `Vulkan0` as needed.

## Full Conversion

The guarded full base-model conversion is allowed after the compressed runtime
gate passes. Run:

```bash
scripts/run-deepseek-v4-rocmfp4-full-conversion.sh
```

The script writes `.partial` artifacts under:

```text
/mnt/ai-models/rocmfp4-quants/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B
```

It preserves source-native `MXFP4` routed experts, quantizes supported dense
matrices to `Q4_0_ROCMFP4`, validates representative tensor types, and promotes
the final filename only after validation.

Full base-model conversion completed successfully. The guarded validator
promoted the archival mixed artifact after checking representative tensor
types:

```text
/mnt/ai-models/rocmfp4-quants/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B-MXFP4-to-ROCmFP4-STRIX_LEAN.gguf
```

The promoted artifact contains `1328` tensors: `596 Q4_0_ROCMFP4`,
`129 MXFP4`, `3 I32`, `535 F32`, `36 Q5_K`, and `29 Q6_K`.

## Runtime Storage Policy

Use `/mnt/ai-models` for source checkpoints, conversion intermediates, and
archival copies only. Do not run full-model generation tests from the external
model drive.

Copy the promoted artifact to the internal NVMe before runtime testing:

```text
/home/caf/strix-fp4/models/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B-GGUF/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B-MXFP4-to-ROCmFP4-STRIX_LEAN.gguf
```

The DeepSeek V4 smoke harness refuses model paths under `/mnt/ai-models` to
prevent accidental external-drive runtime tests. Store runtime fixtures under
`/home/caf/strix-fp4/runtime-fixtures/deepseek-v4`, not RAM-backed `/tmp`. The
harness also disables mmap by default because mmap prepopulation is not
appropriate for this full artifact on the unified-memory target.

## Full Internal Runtime Gate

The promoted base artifact loads and generates from the internal NVMe on both
GPU backends. These bounded measurements used a seven-token prompt, eight
forced completion tokens, context `512`, and `--no-mmap --no-repack`:

| Backend | Startup to generation | Prompt processing | Decode | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `ROCm0` | `32.1s` | `22.94 tok/s` | `6.91 tok/s` | Functional; FlashAttention auto-disables because DeepSeek helper operations still use CPU fallback |
| `Vulkan0` | `43.7s` | `26.26 tok/s` | `9.53 tok/s` | Functional with current Vulkan backend coverage |

Run the verified internal-NVMe smoke:

```bash
NO_REPACK=1 N_PREDICT=8 \
  scripts/run-deepseek-v4-rocmfp4-smoke.sh \
  /home/caf/strix-fp4/models/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B-GGUF/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B-MXFP4-to-ROCmFP4-STRIX_LEAN.gguf \
  ROCm0
```

Replace `ROCm0` with `Vulkan0` for the Vulkan path. The harness adds
`--no-mmap` by default. Set `NO_MMAP=0` only for controlled loader diagnostics.

## Runtime Notes

The isolated tree includes the DeepSeek V4 metadata, tensor loader, hybrid
compressed-attention cache, graph, and CPU helper operations. ROCm and Vulkan
can execute the compressed fixture, but the DeepSeek-specific helper operations
do not yet have native GPU kernels. The ROCm path currently disables
FlashAttention automatically when the scheduler detects CPU fallback.

The HIP/CUDA concat backend also needed `F16` support for the compact compressed
KV-cache merge. This is a generic backend fix and should be regression-tested
against the existing ROCmFP4 architectures before the feature tree is merged.

The first full-model attempts timed out before graph execution because the
default mmap path issued:

```text
mmap(..., 96429582304, MAP_SHARED|MAP_POPULATE, ...)
```

That eagerly prepopulated the entire mixed GGUF before GPU placement on the
unified-memory target. A bounded internal syscall trace confirmed the cause.
Disabling repack alone did not change the stall. `--no-mmap` avoids the eager
prepopulation and allows both GPU backends to load and generate normally. This
was a loader-policy issue, not an external-drive speed issue or a failed
conversion.

## MTP Phase

MTP remains opt-in and separate from the proven base-model artifact. Pass
`--deepseek4-include-mtp` to `convert_hf_to_gguf.py`, or use the guarded full
conversion wrapper with a third argument of `1`:

```bash
scripts/run-deepseek-v4-rocmfp4-full-conversion.sh \
  /mnt/ai-models/gguf-sources/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B \
  /mnt/ai-models/rocmfp4-quants/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B \
  1
```

The MTP conversion writes distinct `-MTP-` filenames and does not overwrite the
proven base artifact. The guarded full-conversion wrapper also enables
`--use-temp-file` for MTP and spills temporary tensor data under the external
archival directory. This avoids retaining every merged routed-expert tensor in
RAM until final write.

A one-layer-plus-MTP fixture converted and generated
successfully on CPU, `ROCm0`, and `Vulkan0` using native `draft-mtp` staging:

| Backend | Prompt processing | Decode |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| CPU | `109.0 tok/s` | `123.2 tok/s` |
| `ROCm0` | `328.6 tok/s` | `290.6 tok/s` |
| `Vulkan0` | `195.3 tok/s` | `67.8 tok/s` |

These are bounded fixture smoke measurements, not full-model performance
claims. Run the MTP smoke harness with:

```bash
scripts/run-deepseek-v4-mtp-rocmfp4-smoke.sh \
  /home/caf/strix-fp4/runtime-fixtures/deepseek-v4/deepseek-v4-flash-1layer-mtp-rocmfp4-mxfp4.gguf \
  ROCm0
```

Replace `ROCm0` with `CPU` or `Vulkan0` as needed.

The guarded full MTP archival conversion completed successfully on
2026-06-02. Its validator checked all `1360` tensors and promoted:

```text
/mnt/ai-models/rocmfp4-quants/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B-MTP-MXFP4-to-ROCmFP4-STRIX_LEAN.gguf
```

The promoted archival artifact is about `92G`. It was copied and byte-verified
on the internal NVMe at:

```text
/home/caf/strix-fp4/models/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B-GGUF/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B-MTP-MXFP4-to-ROCmFP4-STRIX_LEAN.gguf
```

The first internal full-model `ROCm0` attempt on 2026-06-02 was stopped by a
global host OOM before generation. The model was on the internal NVMe, but
`/tmp` is RAM-backed on this machine and still held about `35G` of disposable
fixture GGUF files. Do not use `/tmp` for multi-gigabyte fixtures on this host.
Use a persistent internal-NVMe scratch directory for runtime fixtures and the
external drive for archival-only artifacts.

The DeepSeek smoke wrappers now refuse full-model launches unless at least
`110 GiB` of RAM is available and `/tmp` usage is at most `2 GiB`. The MTP
wrapper also accepts `N_GPU_LAYERS` and `SPEC_DRAFT_N_GPU_LAYERS` so
internal-drive backend validation can increase offload gradually instead of
immediately requesting full offload.

For full-model MTP testing, use the capped launcher. It adds a user-level
`108G` memory cgroup with swap disabled around the smoke process:

```bash
N_PREDICT=8 \
scripts/run-deepseek-v4-mtp-rocmfp4-capped-smoke.sh \
  /home/caf/strix-fp4/models/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B-GGUF/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-180B-MTP-MXFP4-to-ROCmFP4-STRIX_LEAN.gguf \
  ROCm0
```

Replace `ROCm0` with `Vulkan0` to test Vulkan. The internal full-model artifact
generates successfully with native MTP staging on both GPU backends:

| Backend | Main offload | MTP draft offload | Tokens | Prompt processing | Decode |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `ROCm0` | `999` | `0` | `8` | `31.4 t/s` | `11.2 t/s` |
| `ROCm0` | `999` | `all` | `8` | `31.8 t/s` | `11.2 t/s` |
| `Vulkan0` | `999` | `all` | `8` | `25.1 t/s` | `9.6 t/s` |

These are bounded smoke measurements at context `128`, not long-context
throughput claims. On this short sample, native MTP draft GPU offload is
functional but does not improve ROCm decode speed over keeping the draft layer
on CPU.

The DeepSeek-specific cache follow-up on 2026-06-02 kept native MTP speculative
decoding enabled and changed only the main and draft KV-cache types. Both
quantized-cache attempts were rejected for promotion:

| Main KV | MTP draft KV | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `f16` | `f16` | pass; promoted safe default |
| `q4_0` | `q4_0` | `libllama.so` segmentation fault under the `108G` cgroup |
| `q8_0` | `q8_0` | `libllama.so` segmentation fault under the `108G` cgroup |

Do not use `q4_0` or `q8_0` KV-cache flags for this DeepSeek port until the
quantized-cache crash is fixed. Other ROCmFP4 model families have separately
validated quantized-cache profiles; this restriction is specific to the
current DeepSeek V4 Flash 180B port.

For an interactive terminal chat using the promoted safe flags:

```bash
cd /home/caf/strix-fp4/llama.cpp-deepseek-v4-rocmfp4-modern-port
scripts/run-deepseek-v4-mtp-rocmfp4-chat.sh
```

The launcher uses the internal-NVMe artifact, `ROCm0`, native MTP speculative
decoding, `f16` main and draft KV caches, an initial context of `4096`, and the
same RAM, `/tmp`, and `108G` cgroup safeguards as the bounded smoke wrapper.
The `4096` value is a conservative boot default, not the model limit. The
source model metadata declares a native context of `1048576`; the source
checkpoint author validated `200000` with a different vLLM FP8-KV runtime on
one DGX Spark. Long-context fit in this llama.cpp port still requires its own
validation.

The launcher defaults to non-thinking chat, temperature `0.6`, and an English
system prompt. Override those with `REASONING`, `TEMPERATURE`, or
`SYSTEM_PROMPT`. It also passes
`models/templates/deepseek-ai-DeepSeek-V4.jinja` explicitly.
The current full artifact predates that restored template metadata; without the
override, interactive mode does not encode the required `<｜User｜>` and
`<｜Assistant｜>` markers. Future DeepSeek V4 conversions embed the same
template fallback automatically.

After releasing any resident large model, run the contained long-context
allocation ladder with:

```bash
scripts/run-deepseek-v4-mtp-context-ladder.sh
```

It tests `32768`, `65536`, `131072`, `200000`, `262144`, `524288`, and
`1048576` in order and stops at the first failed allocation. To open an
interactive chat at a validated rung:

```bash
CONTEXT=131072 scripts/run-deepseek-v4-mtp-rocmfp4-chat.sh
```

All seven configured-window acceptance smokes passed on `ROCm0` with native
MTP on 2026-06-02. These shallow tests prove that the graph accepts the native
window and executes; they do not prove that a prompt filling the entire window
fits in physical memory. The recorded table is:

```text
/home/caf/strix-fp4/ROCMFP4-HANDOFF/DEEPSEEK-V4-CONTEXT-RESULTS.md
```

If `/exit` leaves a HIP worker resident during teardown, release it with:

```bash
scripts/stop-deepseek-v4-mtp-rocmfp4-chat.sh
```

The promoted local-agent profile is:

```text
deepseek-v4-flash-180b-mtp-rocmfp4-rocm-best
```

It is available to Pi directly through `pi-llama-strix` on port `8234`, and to
OpenCode and Kilo through the local switching proxy on port `8233`. The proxy
is enabled as the user-login service `kilo-llama-switch.service`; it does not
load the 180B model until a client selects the profile. To start the backend
explicitly:

```bash
/home/caf/.local/bin/pi-llama-strix switch \
  deepseek-v4-flash-180b-mtp-rocmfp4-rocm-best
```

To release model RAM:

```bash
/home/caf/.local/bin/pi-llama-strix stop
```
